## Step States

Steps might be numbered, contain a tick to demonstrate a section is complete, or an exclamation mark to highlight an error

### Numbered

### Tick

<Canvas of={Stepper.CompletedState} />

### Error

<Canvas of={Stepper.ErrorState} />

## Layout

The stepper control supports multiple layouts

### Horizontal (default)

<Canvas of={Stepper.HorizontalLayout} />

### Vertical

<Canvas of={Stepper.VerticalLayout} />

## Stepper flow

### Non-linear

A user can navigate through the steps freely, e.g. in a calculator. They never use the ‘tick’, just numbers and possibly errors

### Linear

The user can only access the next step when the current step is complete / hits the validation criteria.

As the user cannot navigate forwards without completing a section, subsequent steps should be disabled

The user should be able to navigate backwards through sections they have completed though so any previous ‘ticked’ steps should be hoverable, focussable & pressable.
