This component provides a visual representation of progress for tasks and actions or the passage of time.

It supports two main progress states:

- Determinate: Use this for tasks with a defined duration where you can show the completion percentage. The progress bar fills up as the task progresses.
- Indeterminate: Use this for tasks with an unknown duration or where you can't provide a specific percentage. The progress bar animates to indicate ongoing activity without a defined endpoint.

### Secondary

## Indeterminate (without value)

### Primary

### Secondary
